Pathfinding Visualizer
A pathfinding algorithm is an algorithm that helps yoou find the shortest path bettween two points. This is a react.js appliction that visualizes the

Pathfinding Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra’s Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

A* (weighted): arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Greedy best first search (weighted): a faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

Breath first search(unweighted): a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path

Maze Algorithms
This application supports the following maze algorithms:

Recursive division maze

Recursive backtracker

Randomized Prim’ Algorithm

Spiral Maze

Random Mazes
